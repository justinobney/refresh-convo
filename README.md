======

justjs is an autobiographical, open-source blog about node.js development. I'm using it to blog about it.

To get it running you'll need to install node and mongodb and do 'npm install', then:

node server.js

You can override anything in 'options' in 'config-local.js' (see config-local-example.js).

This is a work in progress. It's [running in production at justjs.com](http://justjs.com/) but lots of functionality is yet to come. See the commit log or just follow the blog for current status.
